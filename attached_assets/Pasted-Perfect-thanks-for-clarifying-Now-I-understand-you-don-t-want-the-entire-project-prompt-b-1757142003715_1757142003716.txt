Perfect 👍 thanks for clarifying. Now I understand — you don’t want the **entire project prompt**, but specifically the **landing page hero section** (with the globe + collaboration design like in your screenshot).

Let me **break it down so you (or an AI builder) can recreate it exactly**:

---

## 🌍 Landing Page (Hero Section) Breakdown

### 1. **Main Layout**

* **Full-screen background** → gradient deep blue (space-like).

* **Centerpiece** → 3D **Earth model** (rotatable).

* **Left Side (Text Block):**

  * Large bold headline: *“Save the Earth”*
  * Subtext: 2–3 lines (about climate change, global warming, etc.).
  * CTA Button: *“Watch Video”* (with an icon).

* **Right Side (Vertical List of Topics/Chapters):**

  * Example items:

    * Save the Ocean 🌊
    * Climate Change 🌡️
    * Arctic is Calling ❄️
    * Quench the Thirsty 💧
    * (…extendable list)
  * Each has a **thumbnail image + title**.
  * On hover → thumbnail enlarges slightly, glowing border.

* **Top Right:**

  * Navigation → “About” | “Contact”

* **Left Vertical Bar:**

  * Social icons (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook).

---

### 2. **3D Globe (Hero Element)**

* Format: `.glb` Earth model.
* Features:

  * **Idle slow rotation**.
  * **Interactive drag** to rotate manually.
  * **Subtle glow/atmosphere** effect around the Earth.
  * **Cloud texture layer** slowly moving.

---

### 3. **Animations**

* Globe rotates smoothly.
* When user scrolls → hero shrinks slightly, next section fades in.
* Thumbnails on the right → animate in with fade + slide.
* Hover on “Watch Video” → button glow/pulse.

---

### 4. **Tech Notes**

* **Three.js or React Three Fiber** for globe rendering.
* **GSAP / Framer Motion** for smooth animations.
* **Responsive Design** → mobile view: text moves below globe, list becomes horizontal slider.

## 📝 Example Prompt for AI (just the hero page)

> I uploaded a 3D Earth model (`earth.glb`) and a reference screenshot.
> Please build a **landing page hero section** that matches the design.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> * Fullscreen hero section with deep blue gradient background.
> * Center: interactive 3D globe (rotatable, idle rotation, glowing atmosphere, clouds).
> * Left: Large heading “Save the Earth”, small subtext (about climate issues), and a CTA button (“Watch Video”).
> * Right: Vertical list of 4–5 cards with image + text (e.g., Save the Ocean, Climate Change). Hover enlarges the card.
> * Top right: simple nav (About, Contact).
> * Left vertical bar: social media icons.
> * Smooth animations (fade-in, hover effects, globe rotation).
> * Use React + Three.js (React Three Fiber) or Three.js vanilla.
> * Responsive for mobile (stacked layout).
>
> Style = clean, futuristic, same as screenshot.

👉 This way, AI/dev knows **you only want the hero landing page with the Earth + sidebar content**, not the full platform.

Do you want me to also **sketch a wireframe mockup** (simple box layout) so you can visualize the structure before building?
